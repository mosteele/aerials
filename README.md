aerials
=======

Scripts for processing aerial imagery.  These operations include changes of format, compression, addition of overviews, reprojection, resampling and retiling.  Code in this repo relies exclusively on open source tools, namely: gdal/ogr, shapely & fiona.

I forked this project from Grant Humphries in August 2016 to make changes needed to re-run the script with new Metro imagery.
